            Phuket beaches: an overview of the best options for tourists with
            different requests
          </h3>
          <p>
            Paradise beaches with velvety white sand are the main attraction of
            Phuket in Thailand. There are many beaches here, and you will not
            find two similar ones. Some delight with silence and a peaceful
            atmosphere, while others never end the party. There are long white
            sandy beaches and tiny bays hidden between coastal cliffs. Some are
            known to every tourist, while others are known only to locals. In a
            word, the beauty of Phuket is that everyone here can find a beach to
            their liking. All about the beaches of Phuket - in our review.

            What to be guided by when choosing a beach in Phuket
          </h4>
          <p>
            Most Phuket hotels are located along the beaches of the west coast,
            with the beaches in the southern part of the island (Patong, Kalim,
            Nai Harn, Yanui, Karon, Kata) the most popular. As a result, the
            infrastructure is developed here, there are a lot of shops and
            restaurants, but there are also a lot of tourists. The beaches in
            the northern part of the island (Surin, Kamala, Bang Tao, Nai Thon,
            Mai Khao and Nai Yang) are less in demand, there are few benefits of
            civilization and entertainment, but there are also people: for
            example, on the long beach of Nai Yang you can meet only a dozen
            human.However, in order to have fun in a club or go shopping, you
            will have to cross half of the island. That is why, if you decide to
            stay in the north of the island, you will have to pay extra for the
            transfer when buying excursions.
          </p>
          <p class="py-2">
            There are practically no beaches suitable for recreation on the east
            coast of the island - they are all occupied by fishing marinas, so
            it makes no sense for lovers of relaxing by the sea to stop here.
            Phuket Town, the administrative center of the island, will not be
            the best choice either: it is quite far to get to any beach from
            here, and the town itself, despite its peculiar charm, cannot offer
            tourists a wide range of entertainment.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, the beaches of Phuket - which one to choose? All of them are
            amazing, unique, beautiful, and the choice depends on your
            preferences. What would you like from your vacation? Noise, parties,
            discos, crowds? Or solitude, isolation, silence and unity with
            nature? To help you with your choice, here are a few beach ratings
            in Phuket.
          </p>
          <h4 id="th_l3" class="text-center py-3">Rating of Phuket beaches:</h4>
          <p>
            Almost every site dedicated to the Kingdom of Thailand has its own
            rating of Phuket beaches. And these rankings are very similar. We
            took as a basis an overview of the beaches of Phuket, compiled by
            the authors of the SpiritRelax travel portal. According to the
            compilers, the leadership in different categories belongs to the
            following beaches:
          </p>
          <p><strong>The cleanest:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bang Tao, Kalim, Kata, Kamala, Nai Thon, Yanui - 1st place.</li>

            <li>Nai Tong, Nai Yang - 4th place.</li>
            <li>Yanui - 5th place.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The most expensive:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Patong, Karon, Bang Tao, Surin - the highest prices.</li>
            <li>
              Kalim, Kata, Nai Ton, Nai Yang, Yanui - the average price segment.
            </li>
            <li>Kamala, Nai Harn â€” low prices.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Leading beaches for entertainment:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Patong, Karon, Bang Tao - 1st place.</li>
            <li>Kata, Surin - 2nd place.</li>
            <li>Kalim, Kamala, Nai Harn - 3rd place.</li>
            <li>Nai Tong, Nai Yang - 4th place.</li>
            <li>Yanui - 5th place.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Leading beaches by the number of shops:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Patong, Karon, Bang Tao - 1st place.</li>
            <li>Kata, Kamala, Surin - 2nd place.</li>
            <li>Kalim, Nai Harn - 3rd place.</li>
            <li>Nai Tong, Nai Yang - 4th place.</li>
            <li>Yanui - 5th place.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Thus, the beaches of Patong, Karon, Kata, Kalim, Kamala, Nai Harn,
            Bang Tao and Surin can be considered the best of the best in terms
            of a combination of features. We will talk about them in more
            detail.

            Review of the best beaches in Phuket:
          </h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Patong.</strong>The most famous, fun and crowded beach of
            the island. Most of the clubs, restaurants and bars for every taste
            are concentrated here, and one of the best shopping centers of the
            island, Jungceylon, is also located here. The choice of hotels in
            Patong is huge: from the most expensive hotels to incredibly cheap
            guest houses and hostels. In a word, this is a very convenient place
            to relax, but it has a minus: there are always a lot of people on
            the beach, and the Thai services responsible for order and
            cleanliness do not always have time to remove the garbage that
            irresponsible tourists scatter. Nevertheless, the beach itself is
            very beautiful, the entrance to the sea is sandy and relatively
            smooth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Kalim </strong>is the northernmost part of Patong.
            Geographically, Kalim and Patong are the same beach. But the
            atmosphere here is completely different - it is much quieter and
            calmer, there are fewer tourists, there are no noisy bars and
            discos. Kalim and the entire northern region of Patong is a good
            choice for those who want both parties and a quiet beach holiday at
            the same time. If you stay at Kalima, then you can drive to all the
            benefits of civilization that Patong offers in 3 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Karon.</strong>This beach is considered a family one. Of
            course, there are clubs and bars here too, but Karon is much quieter
            than Patong. At the same time, there is everything you need for a
            comfortable stay - restaurants with Thai and European cuisine, spas,
            shops, markets with fruits and souvenirs, a variety of
            entertainment. Karon is an exceptionally beautiful long beach with
            white coral sand that creaks pleasantly underfoot like snow. And
            this beach is the most popular among Russians.
          </p>
          <p class="custom_border">
            <strong>Kata.</strong>The one and a half kilometer Kata beach is
            located next to Karon, if you wish, you can walk to it on foot. This
            is a picturesque clean beach with the smoothest entry into the sea.
            In terms of atmosphere and level of infrastructure, it is very
            similar to Karon, so families with children, honeymooners looking
            for romance, and everyone who does not like the crowd, noise and
            round-the-clock party prefer to stay here. The southern part is more
            pleasant, because in the northern part of Kata a river overgrown
            with silt flows into the sea.

            For many years, Phuket has been breaking records in terms of
            popularity and demand among travelers. And not without reason,
            because the resorts of the island are located on excellent beaches,
            sea water pleases with cleanliness and transparency, and vacation
            prices have always been kept at an affordable level.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to many tourists, Phuket is a strong and worthy compromise
            between the ambiguous Pattaya and places like Koh Samui, Krabi or
            Phi Phi. The island has heavenly views, tranquil lagoons,
            traditional temples and hundreds of entertainment venues.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the capital of the island, Phuket Town, you can wander the
            streets and enjoy the amazing architecture, and then rent a bike and
            drive to one of the many viewing platforms or to any beach.
            Everything is nearby, so the traveler does not have to travel
            hundreds of kilometers of tiresome road.

            Top 3 attractions in phuket
          </h4>
          <h5>Big Buddha</h5>
          <p>
            The monument is 45 meters high, installed on the Nakkerd hill in the
            southern part of the city. The Buddha statue is part of a large
            temple complex, which is being built with charitable funds. The
            construction of the monastery began in 2002 and continues to this
            day. Anyone can donate money for the construction. The majestic
            statue of the god is visible from many points in Phuket, several
            roads lead to the sights from the coast.
          </p>
          <h5>Temple Wat Chalong</h5>
          <p>
            The temple is located in the center of the island on the way to the
            Big Buddha statue. The attraction is included in all Phuket
            sightseeing tours. Wat Chalong is the largest and most picturesque
            temple on the island. It is well-deservedly popular among tourists.
            In the interior, gilding prevails in the decoration of elements, the
            floor is laid out of marble. The walls are painted with frescoes
            depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha.
          </p>
          <h5>Suwan Khiri Ket Temple</h5>
          <p class="custom_border">
            The building was built at the very end of the 19th century in the
            Karon beach area. The small building of the temple looks quite
            well-groomed, as it is carefully monitored. At the entrance there
            are figures of guard kites of emerald color. Twice a week, a night
            market operates on the site near the temple, where you can buy food
            and clothes. Some tourists claim that you can enter the territory of
            the monastery in a bathing suit, given its location on the beach.
